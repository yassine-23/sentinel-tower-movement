Edit any text or statistics in the section files:
```
components/sections/HeroSection.tsx

components/sections/SolutionSection.tsx
components/sections/EconomicsSection.tsx
components/sections/CallToActionSection.tsx
```

### 2. Add Real Images (Optional)

Replace emoji placeholders with actual photos:
- Wildfire imagery for hero section
- Turbine blade photos (landfill vs. installed)
- Sentinel tower prototype images

Place images in `/public/` folder and update components.

### 3. Connect Email Form

The email form currently shows an alert. Connect it to:
- **Mailchimp** API
- **SendGrid**
- **ConvertKit**
- Or your preferred email service

Update the `handleSubmit` function in `CallToActionSection.tsx`.

### 4. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd immune-system-website
vercel
```

Follow the prompts. Your site will be live in ~2 minutes at a vercel.app URL.

#### Option B: Netlify

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (drag & drop the .next folder)
```

#### Option C: Custom Server

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

## 🎥 Create Viral Content

### Video Concept (for X/Social Media)

**60-second structure:**

1. **0-10s**: Show massive turbine blade in landfill (shocking)
2. **10-20s**: Cut to devastating wildfire footage (emotional)
3. **20-35s**: Reveal: Blade standing vertical as "tree" tower (surprise)
4. **35-50s**: Show detection demo: fire starts → detected → water deployed → fire dies
5. **50-60s**: Stats on screen + website URL + "Help us build the first 100"

### Hashtags for Launch

```
#CircularEconomy #WildfirePrevention #ClimateInnovation
#RenewableEnergy #Sustainability #GreenTech #Innovation
#EnvironmentalSolution #ZeroWaste
```
