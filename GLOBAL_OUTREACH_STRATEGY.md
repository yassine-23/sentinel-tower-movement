✓ Generate revenue from "waste" asset
✓ ESG/sustainability credentials
✓ Community wildfire protection (social license)
✓ Co-branding opportunity ("Powered by [Your Brand]")

PARTNERSHIP MODELS:
1. BLADE DONATION → Tax write-off + PR value
2. REVENUE SHARE → % of tower operational savings
3. CO-INVESTMENT → Joint venture on deployments
4. SERVICE CONTRACT → Long-term maintenance partner

VESTAS CASE STUDY OPPORTUNITY:
• First 100 blades from decommissioned CA wind farms
• Document transformation process
• Joint announcement at WindEurope Summit
• Industry-leading circular economy model

The EU's Circular Economy Action Plan is driving blade recyclability mandates. This is your proactive solution.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Revolutionary "Sentinel Towers" Transform Wind Turbine Waste
into Wildfire Prevention Infrastructure

[City, Date] - Immune System Project today announced the deployment of the world's first Sentinel Tower, a breakthrough circular economy solution that repurposes decommissioned wind turbine blades into intelligent wildfire detection and suppression infrastructure.

With wildfires causing $300 billion in annual global damage and 43 million tons of non-recyclable turbine blades facing disposal by 2050, Sentinel Towers solve two planetary crises simultaneously.

"Traditional fire detection takes 30+ minutes. Sentinel Towers detect fires in under 5 minutes and deploy autonomous suppression before spread," said [Founder Name]. "We're not just preventing fires—we're proving regenerative infrastructure works."

Each 50-meter tower covers 500 acres, costs $50,000, and prevents an average of $5 million in fire damage—a 100x return on investment.

The first prototype is being deployed in [Location] in partnership with [Government Agency], with plans to scale to 100 towers by 2025.
